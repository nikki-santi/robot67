# Team name: 67

## Robot name: Botzilla
 
### Robot duty: Ping pong ball delivery
When a ping ball ball is dropped onto the floor the bot will use a claw to pick up the claw and grip the ball. It will then start driving to wherever the user/driver of the bot would like. The bot need to be able to go on and around many different surfaces. The most important thing is the material of the bot will be the tires and the claw to create a non slick surface wich wont drop the ball. 

### Updates
#### 9/23- Had first Sumo match against class. Right front wheel came off during battle as well as some locking nuts. 1-1-1 record from the matches.
#### 9/25- Making changes on  robot, switching wheels to the omni-direction wheels for all 4 sides to increase ability to manuvuer on the concrete floor. Correcting the tightness of the locking nuts so they don't fall off when hit by other robots.
#### 9/30- Switched back to green terrain wheels so we were no longer drifting. Second sumo match 1-1 lost one and won one.
#### 10/2- Talked about autonomy and researched it for our bot.
#### 10/7- Coded for autonomous mode.
#### 10/9- Autonomous code finished and working, attached U shaped arm to contain donut within the bounds of the robot.
#### 10/10- Tweaking velocity of autonomous mode 
#### 10/14- Successful autonomous mode, 180 turns need to be modified 
#### 10/21- ![sketch](https://github.com/nikki-santi/robot67/blob/main/images/clawbotsketch.png?raw=true)
