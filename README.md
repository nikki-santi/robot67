When a ping ball ball is dropped onto the floor the bot will use a claw to pick up the claw and grip the ball. It will then start driving to wherever the user/driver of the bot would like. The bot need to be able to go on and around many different surfaces. The most important thing is the material of the bot will be the tires and the claw to create a non slick surface wich wont drop the ball.
